# RedRange-TBCC
Range spell check, an Old addon ported for TBC Classic, since RangeRecolors and RangeColors wasn't working well.

RedRange is yet another addon which reds out standard ActionButtons when they're out of range, mostly useful if you've got the extra buttons enabled or if you dont notice just the shortcut key color change.

This is short and sweet and in theory very efficient (It follows the same guidelines as the standard UI with respect to update speed etc, though it's better on a bar switch than the standard UI).
